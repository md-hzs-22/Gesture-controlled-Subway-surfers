# Hand Gesture Controlled Subway Surfers

A Python project that lets you play **Subway Surfers** (or similar keyboard-controlled games) using **hand gestures** captured from a webcam.  
It uses **OpenCV**, **MediaPipe Hands**, and multithreading for smooth real-time gesture detection and game control.

---

## âœ¨ Features
- ðŸŽ¥ **Multithreaded camera capture** for low-latency video processing.  
- âœ‹ **Real-time hand gesture recognition** using MediaPipe.  
- ðŸŽ® **Keyboard emulation** to map gestures (Jump, Roll, Left, Right, Start) into game actions.  
- ðŸ“Š Live **FPS counter** for performance monitoring.

## ðŸŽ® Gesture Mapping
| Gesture Region | Action  |
|----------------|---------|
| Top            | Jump    |
| Bottom         | Roll    |
| Left           | Move Left |
| Right          | Move Right |
| Center (Start) | Start the Game |
